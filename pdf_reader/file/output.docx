Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC)

PRAC recommendations on signals
Adopted at the 3-6 May 2021 PRAC meeting

This document provides an overview of the recommendations adopted by the Pharmacovigilance Risk
Assessment Committee (PRAC) on the signals discussed during the meeting of 3-6 May 2021 (including
the signal European Pharmacovigilance Issues Tracking Tool [EPITT] 2 reference numbers).
PRAC recommendations to provide supplementary information are directly actionable by the concerned
marketing authorisation holders (MAHs). PRAC recommendations for regulatory action (e.g.
amendment of the product information) are submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use (CHMP) for endorsement when the signal concerns Centrally Authorised Products (CAPs),
and to the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures – Human (CMDh)
for information in the case of Nationally Authorised Products (NAPs). Thereafter, MAHs are expected to
take action according to the PRAC recommendations.
When appropriate, the PRAC may also recommend the conduct of additional analyses by the Agency or
Member States.
MAHs are reminded that in line with Article 16(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004 and Article 23(3) of
Directive 2001/83/EC, they shall ensure that their product information is kept up to date with the
current scientific knowledge including the conclusions of the assessment and recommendations
published on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website (currently acting as the EU medicines
webportal).
For CAPs, at the time of publication, PRAC recommendations for update of product information have
been agreed by the CHMP at their plenary meeting (17-20 May 2021) and corresponding variations will
be assessed by the CHMP.
For nationally authorised medicinal products, it is the responsibility of the National Competent
Authorities (NCAs) of the Member States to oversee that PRAC recommendations on signals are
adhered to.
Variations for CAPs are handled according to established EMA procedures. MAHs are referred to the
available guidance. Variations for NAPs (including via mutual recognition and decentralised procedures)
are handled at national level in accordance with the provisions of the Member States.

Recommendation
The PRAC has considered available evidence ascertained from EudraVigilance, the literature, nonclinical
and clinical data and additional data submitted by Sanofi Belgium. Based on review of the weighted
cumulative evidence, PRAC considers that a causal relation between Sarcoidosis and Alemtuzumab
cannot be excluded. The PRAC recommends that the MAH for Lemtrada, Sanofi Belgium, should submit
a variation within 2 months from the publication of the PRAC recommendation, to amend the product
information as described below (new text underlined):
The proposal to update the SmPC and PIL is as follows (new text underlined, text to be removed
struck-through).
Summary of product characteristics
4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use
Autoimmunity
Treatment may result in the formation of autoantibodies and increase the risk of autoimmune
mediated conditions which may be serious and life threatening. Reported autoimmune conditions,
include thyroid disorders, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), nephropathies (e.g. antiglomerular basement membrane disease), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and acquired haemophilia A,
and sarcoidosis. In the post-marketing setting, patients developing multiple autoimmune disorders
after LEMTRADA treatment have been observed.
Patients who develop autoimmunity should be assessed for other autoimmune mediated conditions
(see section 4.3). Patients and physicians should be made aware of the potential later onset of
autoimmune disorders after the 48 months monitoring period.

More helpful information about these autoimmune conditions (and the testing for them) can be found
in the LEMTRADA Patient Guide.
[…]
o Liver inflammation
Some patients have developed liver inflammation after receiving LEMTRADA. Liver inflammation can be
diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly after LEMTRADA treatment. If you
develop one or more of the following symptoms report this to your doctor: nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, or bleeding or bruising more
easily than normal.
o Sarcoidosis
There have been reports of an immune system disorder (sarcoidosis) in patients treated with
LEMTRADA. Symptoms can include persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, lymph
node swelling, weight loss, skin rashes, and blurred vision.
o Other autoimmune conditions
Uncommonly, patients have experienced autoimmune conditions involving red blood cells or white
blood cells. These can be diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly after
LEMTRADA treatment. If you develop one of these conditions your doctor will tell you, and take
appropriate measures to treat it.
[…]
4. Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The most important side effects are the autoimmune conditions described in section 2 which include:
[…]
•

Thyroid disorders (very common – may affect more than 1 in 10 people): may show as
excessive sweating; unexplained weight-loss or gain; eye swelling; nervousness; fast
heartbeat; feeling cold; worsening tiredness; or newly occurring constipation.

•

Respiratory toxicity
Very rare, severe cases of respiratory toxicity, sometimes progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS), have been reported during co-trimoxazole treatment. The onset of pulmonary signs
such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs of pulmonary infiltrates, and
deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of ARDS. In such circumstances, cotrimoxazole should be discontinued and appropriate treatment given.

Authorisation procedure

Non-centralised

EPITT No

19655

PRAC rapporteur(s)

Nikica Mirošević Skvrce (HR)

Date of adoption

6 May 2021

Recommendation [see also section 3]
The PRAC has considered the available evidence in EudraVigilance, the literature, and the data
submitted by Roche/ Eumedica, Aspen Pharma and Teva regarding the risk of Haemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in combination. The PRAC agrees that
the available information is considered sufficient to support a warning statement in the product
information. Therefore, the PRAC recommends that the marketing authorisation holders for medicinal
products containing sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in combination should submit a variation within 2
months from the publication of the adopted recommendation to amend the product information as
described below (new text underlined and in bold).
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis should also be added as important safety concern and should be
monitored and analysed by marketing authorisation holders in PSURs.

Summary of product characteristics
4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
Cases of HLH have been reported very rarely in patients treated with co-trimoxazole. HLH is
a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterised by clinical signs
and symptoms of an excessive systemic inflammation (e.g. fever, hepatosplenomegaly,
hypertriglyceridaemia, hypofibrinogenaemia, high serum ferritin, cytopenias and

PRAC recommendations on signals

Page 8/15

haemophagocytosis). Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune
activation should be evaluated immediately. If diagnosis of HLH is established, cotrimoxazole treatment should be discontinued.

Package leaflet
2. What you need to know before you take <product name>
Warnings and precautions
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
There have been very rare reports about excessive immune reactions due to a dysregulated
activation of white blood cells resulting in inflammations (haemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis), which can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated early. If
you experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, feeling weak, lightheaded,
shortness of breath, bruising, or skin rash simultaneously or with a slight delay, contact
your doctor immediately.

1.7. Tramadol; tramadol, dexketoprofen; tramadol, paracetamol –
Serotonin syndrome
Authorisation procedure

Non-centralised

EPITT No

19635

PRAC rapporteur(s)

Tiphaine Vaillant (FR)

Date of adoption

6 May 2021

Recommendation
Having considered the available evidence and following the assessment of the data submitted by the
concerned Marketing Authorisation Holders (MAHs), the PRAC has agreed that the product information
for tramadol should be updated to reflect the risk of serotonin syndrome.
All the MAHs of products containing tramadol, including the fixed combinations of tramadolparacetamol and tramadol-dexketoprofen, should submit a variation within two months from the
publication of the PRAC recommendation, to amend the product information as described here (new
text underlined)*:
Summary of product characteristics
4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use
Serotonin syndrome
Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, has been reported in patients receiving
tramadol in combination with other serotonergic agents or tramadol alone (see sections 4.5, 4.8 and
4.9).
If concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, careful observation of
the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose escalations.

PRAC recommendations on signals
EMA/PRAC/250777/2021

Page 9/15

Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes, autonomic instability,
neuromuscular abnormalities and/or gastrointestinal symptoms.
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be
considered depending on the severity of the symptoms. Withdrawal of the serotonergic drugs usually
brings about a rapid improvement.

4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant therapeutic use of tramadol and serotonergic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), MAO inhibitors (see section
4.3), tricyclic antidepressants and mirtazapine may cause serotonin toxicity syndrome, a potentially
life-threatening condition (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Serotonin syndrome is likely when one of the
following is observed:
• Spontaneous clonus
• Inducible or ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis
• Tremor and hyperreflexia
• Hypertonia and body temperature > 38 °C and inducible or ocular clonus
Withdrawal of the serotonergic drugs usually brings about a rapid improvement. Treatment depends on
the type and severity of the symptoms.

4.8. Undesirable effects
Nervous system disorders
Not known: Serotonin syndrome

4.9. Overdose
Serotonin syndrome has also been reported.

already included in the product information will have to be modified/adjusted in order to accommodate
the new text stated in this PRAC recommendation.

1.8. COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) - COVID-19 Vaccine
Janssen - Embolic and thrombotic events 5
Authorisation procedure

Centralised

EPITT No

19689

PRAC rapporteur(s)

Ulla Wändel Liminga (SE)

Date of adoption

6 May 2021

Recommendation [see also section 3]
The PRAC has reviewed additional evidence concerning thromboembolic events in association with
Covid-19 Janssen vaccine, with particular focus on cases with combination of thrombosis and
thrombocytopenia. Recently, this condition has been named ‘thrombosis with thrombocytopenia
syndrome (TTS)’. The updated review has included data ascertained from newly identified
spontaneously reported cases both in EudraVigilance and other sources, clinical, pre-clinical and
literature data and data from the marketing authorisation holder (MAH).
Based on review of the available evidence the PRAC considers that further updates to the product
information are required including information to outline that patients who are diagnosed with
5

Translations in all EU languages have already been included in the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen product information.

PRAC recommendations on signals
EMA/PRAC/250777/2021

Page 11/15

thrombocytopenia within three weeks of vaccination should be actively investigated for signs of
thrombosis. Similarly, updates have been included in order to reflect that patients who present with
thrombosis within 3 weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia. Furthermore, the
condition should be renamed ‘thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome’.
The PIL should be updated to include information at the start of section 4, concerning the signs and
symptoms of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia.
The PRAC has also reviewed preclinical and literature data concerning possible pathophysiological
mechanisms. A plan concerning additional pharmacovigilance activities, aimed to further elucidate
potential pathophysiological mechanism(s) for TTS, and for quantification of the magnitude of the risk,
should be submitted.
Following further consideration, the text regarding TTS which was added to section 6 of the package
leaflet following the extraordinary PRAC meeting on 20 April 2021, should be removed. The reason is
that it is not considered to fulfil the purpose of the information to be added to that section of the
package leaflet, as per the requirements specified in QRD template 10.2.
The PRAC recommends that the MAH for Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen (Janssen-Cilag International NV)
should submit a variation by 7th May 2021 (8am) to amend the product information as described below
(new text underlined/text to be removed with strikethrough):
Section 4.4
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been
observed very rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe cases
of venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein
thrombosis as well as arterial thrombosis concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been
reported. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in women
under 60 years of age.
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent
abdominal pain following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including
severe or persistent headaches, seizures, mental status change or blurred vision after vaccination, or
who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek
prompt medical attention.
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia requires specialised clinical management.
Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g.,
haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and treat this condition.
Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within 3 weeks after vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine
Janssen should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis. Similarly, individuals who present with
thrombosis within 3 weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia.

Blood disorders
A combination of blood clots and low levels of ‘platelets’ (cells that help blood to clot) in the blood has
been observed very rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe
cases with blood clots, including in unusual locations such as the brain, liver, bowel and spleen, in
some cases in combination with bleeding. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following
vaccination and occurred mostly in women below 60 years of age. Fatal outcome has been reported.
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe or persistent headaches, seizures (fits),
mental status change or blurred vision, unexplained skin bruising beyond the site of vaccination which
appear a few days after vaccination, pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination, develop
shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain. Inform your health
care provider that you have recently received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.
Section 4
Like all vaccines, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Most of the side effects occur in the 1 or 2 days of getting the vaccination.
Get medical attention immediately if within 3 weeks of vaccination you get any of the following
symptoms:

-

experience a severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, mental status changes or seizures
(fits)

-

develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain or persistent abdominal pain

-

notice unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination

Get urgent medical attention if you get symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. …. …//
Section 6
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
[…]
•

Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism
and/or thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical
attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg
swelling, or persistent abdominal pain following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with
neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches, seizures, mental status
change or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond
the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention. Thrombosis in
combination with thrombocytopenia requires specialised clinical management. Healthcare
professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g.,
haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and treat this condition.
